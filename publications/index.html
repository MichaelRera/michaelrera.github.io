To advance our understanding of the population genetics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we present an expanded release of the community-generated population genomics resource Drosophila Evolution over Space and Time (DEST 2.0; https://dest.bio/). This release includes 530 high-quality pooled libraries from flies collected across six continents over more than a decade (2009-2021), most at multiple time points per year; 211 of these libraries are sequenced and shared here for the first time. We used this enhanced resource to elucidate several aspects of the species’ demographic history and identify novel signs of adaptation across spatial and temporal dimensions. We showed that patterns of secondary contact, originally characterized in North America, are replicated in South America and Australia. We also found that the spatial genetic structure of populations is stable over time, but that drift due to seasonal contractions of population size causes populations to diverge over time. We identified signals of adaptation that vary between continents in genomic regions associated with xenobiotic resistance, consistent with independent adaptation to common pesticides. Moreover, by analyzing samples collected during spring and fall across Europe, we provide new evidence for seasonal adaptation related to loci associated with pathogen response. Furthermore, we have also released an updated version of the DEST genome browser. This is a useful tool for studying spatio-temporal patterns of genetic variation in this classic model system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Zane2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ageing as a two-phase process: theoretical framework</div> <div class="author">Zane, Flaminia, MacMurray, Claire, Guillermain, Clémence, Cansell, Céline, Todd, Nicolas, and Rera, Michael </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Front. Aging</em> 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Human ageing, along with the ageing of conventional model organisms, is depicted as a continuous and progressive decline of biological capabilities accompanied by an exponentially increasing mortality risk. However, not all organisms experience ageing identically and our understanding of the phenomenon is coloured by human-centric views. Ageing is multifaceted and influences a diverse range of species in varying ways. Some undergo swift declines post-reproduction, while others exhibit insubstantial changes throughout their existence. This vast array renders defining universally applicable “ageing attributes” a daunting task. It is nonetheless essential to recognize that not all ageing features are organism-specific. These common attributes have paved the way for identifying “hallmarks of ageing,” processes that are intertwined with age, amplified during accelerated ageing, and manipulations of which can potentially modulate or even reverse the ageing process. Yet, a glaring observation is that individuals within a single population age at varying rates. To address this, demographers have coined the term ‘frailty’. Concurrently, scientific advancements have ushered in the era of molecular clocks. These innovations enable a distinction between an individual’s chronological age (time since birth) and biological age (physiological status and mortality risk). In 2011, the “Smurf” phenotype was unveiled in Drosophila, delineating an age-linked escalation in intestinal permeability that presages imminent mortality. It not only acts as a predictor of natural death but identifies individuals exhibiting traits normally described as age-related. Subsequent studies have revealed the phenotype in organisms like nematodes, zebrafish, and mice, invariably acting as a death predictor. Collectively, these findings have steered our conception of ageing towards a framework where ageing is not linear and continuous but marked by two distinct, necessary phases, discernible in vivo, courtesy of the Smurf phenotype. This framework includes a mathematical enunciation of longevity trends based on three experimentally measurable parameters. It facilitates a fresh perspective on the evolution of ageing as a function. In this article, we aim to delineate and explore the foundational principles of this innovative framework, emphasising its potential to reshape our understanding of ageing, challenge its conventional definitions, and recalibrate our comprehension of its evolutionary trajectory.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="roget2024positive" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A scenario for an evolutionary selection of ageing</div> <div class="author">Roget, Tristan, MacMurray, Claire, Jolivet, Pierre, Méléard, Sylvie, and Rera, Michael </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>eLife</em> 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Signs of ageing become apparent only late in life, after organismal development is finalized. Ageing, most notably, decreases an individual’s fitness. As such, it is most commonly perceived as a non-adaptive force of evolution and considered a by-product of natural selection. Building upon the evolutionarily conserved age-related Smurf phenotype, we propose a simple mathematical life-history trait model in which an organism is characterized by two core abilities: reproduction and homeostasis. Through the simulation of this model, we observe (1) the convergence of fertility’s end with the onset of senescence, (2) the relative success of ageing populations, as compared to non-ageing populations, and (3) the enhanced evolvability (i.e. the generation of genetic variability) of ageing populations. In addition, we formally demonstrate the mathematical convergence observed in (1). We thus theorize that mechanisms that link the timing of fertility and ageing have been selected and fixed over evolutionary history, which, in turn, explains why ageing populations are more evolvable and therefore more successful. Broadly speaking, our work suggests that ageing is an adaptive force of evolution.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1093/gbe/evad201" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Alignment-based protein mutational landscape prediction: doing more with less</div> <div class="author">Abakarova, Marina, Marquet, Céline, Rera, Michael, Rost, Burkhard, and Laine, Elodie </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Genome Biology and Evolution</em> Nov 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The wealth of genomic data has boosted the development of computational methods predicting the phenotypic outcomes of missense variants.

Here, we show the usefulness of this strategy for mutational outcome prediction through a large-scale assessment of 1.5M missense variants across 72 protein families. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of producing alignment-based mutational landscape predictions that are both high-quality and compute-efficient for entire proteomes.

This phenotype allowed us to model ageing as being made of two successive phases : a phase A where individuals are healthy and have no risk of mortality but an age-dependent increasing risk of entering phase B, followed by a phase B where individuals show the so-called hallmarks of ageing and a high risk of death. We will test here whether these two consecutive phases of ageing separated by the Smurf transition are a conserved feature of ageing in the classical mammalian laboratory model Mus musculus. Thanks to a longitudinal longevity study using both males and females from two different mouse genetic backgrounds and by integrating physiological, metabolic and molecular measurements with the life history of approximately 150 mice, we are attempting to identify a phenotypic signature typical of the last phase of life, observable at any chronological age. Validating the two-phase ageing model in a mammalian organism would allow the high risk of imminent death to be better characterized in this model and would extend its implications to a broader range of species for aging research. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="freoa2022drosophilid" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Drosophilid cuticle pigmentation impacts body temperature</div> <div class="author">Freoa, Laurent, Chevin, Luis-Miguel, Christol, Philippe, Méléard, Sylvie, Rera, Michael, Véber, Amandine, and Gibert, Jean-Michel </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Scientific reports</em> Aug 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Cuticle pigmentation has been clearly demonstrated to impact body temperature for several relatively large species of insects, but it was questioned for small insects. Here we used a thermal camera to assess the impact of drosophilid cuticle pigmentation on body temperature when individuals are exposed to light. We compared mutants of large effects within species (Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants). Then we analyzed the impact of naturally occurring pigmentation variation within species complexes (Drosophila americana/Drosophila novamexicana and Drosophila yakuba/Drosophila santomea). Finally we analyzed lines of D. melanogaster with moderate differences in pigmentation. We found significant differences in temperatures for each of the four pairs we analyzed. The temperature differences appeared to be proportional to the differently pigmented area: between Drosophila melanogaster ebony and yellow mutants or between Drosophila americana and Drosophila novamexicana, for which the whole body is differently pigmented, the difference in temperatures was around 0.6 (p/m 0.2) Celsius degrees. By contrast, between D. yakuba and D. santomea or between Drosophila melanogaster Dark and Pale lines, for which only the posterior abdomen is differentially pigmented, we detected a temperature difference of about 0.14 (p/m 0.10) Celsius degrees. This demonstrates that cuticle pigmentation has ecological implications in drosophilids regarding adaptation to environmental temperature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.13946" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Smurfness-based two-phase model of ageing helps deconvolve the ageing transcriptional signature</div> <div class="author">Zane, Flaminia, Bouzid, Hayet, Sosa Marmol, Sofia, Brazane, Mira, Besse, Savandara, Molina, Julia Lisa, Cansell, Céline, Aprahamian, Fanny, Durand, Sylvère, Ayache, Jessica, Antoniewski, Christophe, Todd, Nicolas, Carré, Clément, and Rera, Michael </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Aging Cell</em> Aug 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Abstract Ageing is characterised at the molecular level by six transcriptional ‘hallmarks of ageing’, that are commonly described as progressively affected as time passes. By contrast, the ‘Smurf’ assay separates high-and-constant-mortality risk individuals from healthy, zero-mortality risk individuals, based on increased intestinal permeability. Performing whole body total RNA sequencing, we found that Smurfness distinguishes transcriptional changes associated with chronological age from those associated with biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age in non-Smurf individuals preceding the other five hallmarks of ageing that are specifically associated with the Smurf state. Using this approach, we also devise targeted pro-longevity genetic interventions delaying entry in the Smurf state.
