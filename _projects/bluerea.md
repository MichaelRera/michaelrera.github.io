<p>Intestinal permeability increases prior to death in a broad range of organisms including nematodes, Zebrafish <a href= "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23523">(Dambroise et al., 2016)</a> and mice <a href = "https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/preprint/Two_phases_model_of_ageing_in_mice_towards_a_better_identification_of_age-related_and_late-life_metabolic_decline_Registered_Report_Stage_1_Protocol_/23963208">(Cansell et al., 2023)</a> [see also <a href = "https://michaelrera.github.io/projects/miceS/"> Smurfs in mice project</a>].</p>

<p>Previous work in rats <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0531556592900599">(Ma et al., 1988)</a> and macaques suggest that similar a phenomenon might accompany mammals' ageing process. In addition, past clinical research has shown an increased intestinal permeability in the <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1578045/">critically ill patients</a>. More recent work has assessed intestinal permeability to the blue #1 in septic patients <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30502249">(Angarita et al., 2019)</a>.</p>

<p>In the clinical trial Blue-Rea (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06845865), we aim at characterizing intestinal permeability in ICU patients with Single or Multiple Organ Failure and the one year outcome of that measurement. <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl%C3%A9ment-dubost-9b097964/?originalSubdomain=fr">Prof., Dr. Clément Dubost</a> is the principal investigator of the trial.</p>
